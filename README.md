### Description:
We are not Japanese or translators, but we decided to pick this up as a side project due to a huge amount of requests.
This is not a UI only translation anymore, it has become a more then UI translation.

This is our first translation attempt and we will do the best we can.
If you have any questions feel free to contact us.

## Version: 3.2

### Installation:
Extract both Main Game Cia and Update 3.2 Cia then navigate to romfs

Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Game to archive_a.fa Main Games files.

Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Update to archive_a.fa to the 3.2 update files.

Repack both Cia and install both cias.

Both patches need to be applied due to the .fa formated files, not all files in the main .fa are
in the updates .fa. So depending on updates, assure that before installing the main cia to create a backup
as it will delete your save file. Applying the updates cia will not delete your save file.
